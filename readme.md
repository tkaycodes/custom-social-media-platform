### pic10
#### pic10 is a social media platform allowing users to connect and share information with their friends. 'A picture is worth 10 words' - Users can post statuses (10 word max limit), or images. 

###### Implemented Features(so far):

* Users can post statuses (10 words max) or pictures. These posts will show up in all of their friends' newsfeeds.

* Newsfeed posts can be filered to show all posts, only status posts, or only image posts

* When creating a post - users can tag friends, tag a post with existing hastags, or make new ones. These tagged users and hastags are displayed along with the post on the post show page

* Users can send and recieve private messages to and from friends, in addition to sending private messages to users who are currently not their friends. This can be done from the user profile page

* Each user has their own profile page (w/ a profile picture). This page lists all their posts. Profile pictures can be edited by the signed in user

* The most occuring tags are shown in a sidebar, and users can see all posts tagged with a certain hashtag

* Requests for friendships can be rejected or accepted. In this way, the friendship model is similar to facebook (mutual friendships) as opposed to twitter and instagram (i.e - using the followers / following concept)

* All posts can be commented on by users, comments can also be easily edited or deleted
